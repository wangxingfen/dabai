## Core Principles

| Acronym | Full Name | One-liner | Related Rules |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **YAGNI** | You Aren't Gonna Need It | Don't build what you don't need yet | PP-43 |
| **KISS** | Keep It Simple, Stupid | Simplest solution that works | CC-130, PP-72 |
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself | Knowledge should have single source | PP-15, CC-37, CC-128, CC-155 |
| **WET** | Write Everything Twice | Duplication can stay until the pattern is clear | — |
| **AHA** | Avoid Hasty Abstractions | Don't abstract before the concept is real | — |

### YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It

> "Don't implement something until you need it, and don't try to predict the future."

**Review Points:**
- Is this feature actually needed now?
- Are we building for hypothetical future requirements?
- Does this add unnecessary complexity?

**Anti-patterns:**
- Implementing unused factory patterns "for flexibility"
- Adding configuration options nobody asked for
- Building generic frameworks instead of solving the problem

**Related:** PP-43 (Avoid Fortune-Telling)

---

### KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid

> "The simplest solution that works is usually the best one."

**Review Points:**
- Is this the simplest approach that solves the problem?
- Can someone understand this in 5 minutes?
- Are we over-engineering?

**Anti-patterns:**
- Using design patterns where a simple function suffices
- Abstracting code that's only used once
- Creating deep inheritance hierarchies

**Related:** CC-130 (Minimal Classes and Methods), PP-72 (Keep It Simple)

---

### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

> "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation."

**Review Points:**
- Is this the same *knowledge* or just similar *code*?
- If one changes, must the other change too?
- Is the abstraction clear and well-named?

**Important:** DRY is about *knowledge*, not *code text*. Two pieces that look the same but encode different business rules should stay separate (accidental similarity). Two pieces that must always change together share knowledge and need one source (true duplication). See also CA-25.

**Rule of Three (design heuristic):** the first copy teaches little; the second hints; the third often reveals what is shared and what varies. A confirmed same-knowledge count strictly greater than the level's trigger is a Confirmed Violation; equal to the trigger is not a breach.

**Before abstracting, prefer all of:**
1. Single clear business concept (not Utils/Helper/Common).
2. Change coupling: one change forces the others.
3. Named abstraction that reduces total complexity.

**Related:** PP-15, CC-37, CC-128, CC-155, CA-25

## SOLID Principles

| Letter | Principle | One-liner | Rule |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility | One reason to change | CA-8, CC-110 |
| **O** | Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification | CA-9, CC-113 |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable | CA-10 |
| **I** | Interface Segregation | No client should depend on unused methods | CA-11 |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | CA-12, CC-114 |

### SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

> "A class should have only one reason to change."

**Review Points:**
- Does this class/module have multiple responsibilities?
- Would different stakeholders request changes to different parts?
- Can you describe what it does without using "and"?

**Related:** CA-8, CC-110

---

### OCP - Open/Closed Principle

> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

**Review Points:**
- Can new behavior be added without modifying existing code?
- Are we using inheritance/composition appropriately?
- Does adding a feature require touching many files?

**Related:** CA-9, CC-113

---

### LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle

> "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the program."

**Review Points:**
- Can the subclass be used everywhere the parent is expected?
- Does the subclass violate any parent's contract?
- Are we using inheritance for code reuse vs true polymorphism?

**Related:** CA-10

---

### ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

> "No client should be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use."

**Review Points:**
- Is this interface too large?
- Do implementers need to provide empty/dummy methods?
- Should this be split into smaller interfaces?

**Related:** CA-11

---

### DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

> "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."

**Review Points:**
- Does business logic depend on infrastructure details?
- Are dependencies injected or hardcoded?
- Can we swap implementations easily?

**Related:** CA-12, CC-114

## Design Principles

| Acronym | Full Name | One-liner | Rules |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **LoD** | Law of Demeter | Don't talk to strangers | PP-46, CC-80, CC-186 |
| **TDA** | Tell, Don't Ask | Tell objects what to do, don't query them | PP-45, CC-83 |
| **CQS** | Command Query Separation | Methods either change state OR return data, not both | CC-33 |
| **SoC** | Separation of Concerns | Different concerns in different places | CA-23, CC-110 |
| **POLA** | Principle of Least Astonishment | Behavior should match expectations | CC-152 |
| **CoC** | Convention over Configuration | Sensible defaults reduce boilerplate | — |

### LoD - Law of Demeter

> "Only talk to your immediate friends. Don't talk to strangers."

**Review Points:**
- Are there long method chains? (`a.getB().getC().doThing()`)
- Does this code know too much about other objects' internals?
- Should we add a delegating method?

**Related:** PP-46, CC-80, CC-81, CC-186

---

### TDA - Tell, Don't Ask

> "Tell objects what to do, don't ask for their data and operate on it."

**Review Points:**
- Are we getting data just to make a decision?
- Could the object make the decision itself?
- Is logic in the wrong place?

**Related:** PP-45, CC-83

---

### CQS - Command Query Separation

> "A method should either change state OR return information, never both."

**Review Points:**
- Does this method have side effects AND return a value?
- Is the return value informational or for control flow?
- Exception: Pop() from a stack is acceptable.

**Related:** CC-33

---

### POLA - Principle of Least Astonishment

> "Behavior should match what users/developers expect."

**Review Points:**
- Does the function do what its name suggests?
- Are there hidden side effects?
- Would a new developer be surprised?

**Related:** CC-152 (Obvious Behavior Unimplemented)

---

## Testing Principles

| Acronym | Full Name | One-liner | Rules |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **F.I.R.S.T.** | Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, Timely | Test quality criteria | CC-106 |
| **AAA** | Arrange, Act, Assert | Test structure pattern | — |
| **TDD** | Test-Driven Development | Write test first, then code | CC-99, PP-31 |

### F.I.R.S.T.

| Letter | Meaning | Check |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **F** | Fast | Tests run in seconds, not minutes |
| **I** | Independent | Tests don't depend on each other |
| **R** | Repeatable | Same result every time, any environment |
| **S** | Self-Validating | Pass/fail without human interpretation |
| **T** | Timely | Written at the right time (ideally before code) |

**Related:** CC-106

## Component Principles

Component-level design principles from Clean Architecture. These apply when designing packages, modules, or microservices.

### Component Cohesion (What goes together?)

| Acronym | Full Name | One-liner | Rule |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **REP** | Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle | Reusable components must be releasable | CA-14 |
| **CCP** | Common Closure Principle | Classes that change together belong together (SRP for components) | CA-15 |
| **CRP** | Common Reuse Principle | Don't force users to depend on things they don't need (ISP for components) | CA-16 |

### REP - Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle

> "The granule of reuse is the granule of release."

**Review Points:**
- Can this component be versioned and released independently?
- Are all classes in the component releasable together?
- Would upgrading this component bring unrelated changes?

**Related:** CA-14

---

### CCP - Common Closure Principle

> "Gather into components those classes that change for the same reasons and at the same times."

**Review Points:**
- Do classes in this component change together?
- When a requirement changes, does it affect multiple components?
- Is this the component-level SRP?

**Related:** CA-15

---

### CRP - Common Reuse Principle

> "Don't force users of a component to depend on things they don't need."

**Review Points:**
- Does using this component bring unnecessary dependencies?
- Are there classes in this component that users never need?
- Should this component be split?

**Related:** CA-16

---

### Component Coupling (How do components relate?)

| Acronym | Full Name | One-liner | Rule |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **ADP** | Acyclic Dependencies Principle | No cycles in the component dependency graph | CA-18 |
| **SDP** | Stable Dependencies Principle | Depend in the direction of stability | CA-19 |
| **SAP** | Stable Abstractions Principle | Stable components should be abstract | CA-20 |

### ADP - Acyclic Dependencies Principle

> "Allow no cycles in the component dependency graph."

**Review Points:**
- Are there circular dependencies between components/packages?
- Can you build components in a clear order?
- Would changing component A require rebuilding component B and vice versa?

**Breaking Cycles:**
1. **Dependency Inversion** - Add an interface to break the cycle
2. **Extract New Component** - Move shared code to a new component

**Related:** CA-18

---

### SDP - Stable Dependencies Principle

> "Depend in the direction of stability."

**Review Points:**
- Does this component depend on less stable components?
- Are volatile components being depended upon by many others?
- Stable components should be depended upon, not depend on unstable ones

**Stability Metric:**
```
I = Fan-out / (Fan-in + Fan-out)
I = 0: Maximally stable (many dependents, no dependencies)
I = 1: Maximally unstable (no dependents, many dependencies)
```

**Related:** CA-19

---

### SAP - Stable Abstractions Principle

> "A component should be as abstract as it is stable."

**Review Points:**
- Are stable components mostly interfaces/abstract classes?
- Are concrete implementations in unstable components?
- Is there a balance between abstractness and stability?

**The Main Sequence:**
- Components should be near the line from (Abstract=1, Instability=0) to (Abstract=0, Instability=1)
- **Zone of Pain:** Concrete and stable (hard to change)
- **Zone of Uselessness:** Abstract and unstable (never used)

**Related:** CA-20

---

## Architecture Principles

| Principle | One-liner | Rules |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Dependency Rule** | Dependencies point inward toward core | CA-31 |
| **Screaming Architecture** | Architecture should scream its purpose | CA-30 |
| **Plugin Architecture** | Details as plugins to core | CA-47 |
| **Humble Object** | Isolate hard-to-test code | CA-32, CA-46 |

### Dependency Rule

> "Source code dependencies must point only inward, toward higher-level policies."

**Layers (outer to inner):**
1. Frameworks & Drivers (DB, UI, Web)
2. Interface Adapters (Controllers, Gateways)
3. Application Business Rules (Use Cases)
4. Enterprise Business Rules (Entities)

**Related:** CA-31
