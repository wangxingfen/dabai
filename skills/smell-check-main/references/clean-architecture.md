## Part 5: Architecture

| CA-29 | Business Rules | Business rules separated from technical details? Core logic independent? |
| CA-30 | Screaming Architecture | Project structure clearly expresses business use cases? Only seeing framework? |
| CA-31 | The Clean Architecture | Dependencies only point inward? Outer depends on inner? |
| CA-32 | Presenters and Humble Objects | Hard-to-test parts isolated? Using Humble Object pattern? |
| CA-33 | Partial Boundaries | Boundary cost reasonable? Can use more lightweight approach? |
| CA-34 | Layers and Boundaries | Boundaries in appropriate locations? Over-design or under-design? |
| CA-35 | The Main Component | Main component only handles initialization? Correctly transfers control to high level? |

Dependencies point INWARD only.
Inner layers know nothing about outer layers.
```

### The Dependency Rule

> Source code dependencies must point only inward, toward higher-level policies.

**Violations:**
- Entity importing a Controller
- Use Case importing a Database class
- Business rule depending on UI framework

**Correct:**
- Controller imports Use Case interface
- Database implements Repository interface defined by Use Case
- UI calls Application Service

## Part 6: Details

| Rule | Name | Review Point |
|------|------|--------------|
| CA-36 | The Database Is a Detail | Business logic depends on specific database? Easy to swap databases? |
| CA-37 | The Web Is a Detail | Business logic depends on specific UI framework? Easy to swap UI? |
| CA-38 | Frameworks Are Details | Over-depending on framework? Business logic can exist without framework? |
| CA-39 | Case Study: Video Sales | Architecture follows clean architecture principles? Components correctly identified and organized? |
| CA-40 | The Missing Chapter | Package structure reflects architecture? |

### Details Checklist

| Question | Good Sign | Bad Sign |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Can I change the database? | Repository interface with multiple implementations | SQL queries in business logic |
| Can I change the UI? | Presenter pattern, framework-agnostic views | Business logic in controllers |
| Can I change the framework? | Thin framework layer, business logic portable | Framework annotations everywhere |
| Can I test without infrastructure? | Pure unit tests with mocks | Tests require database/network |

## Architecture Decision Checklist

Before making architectural decisions, consider:

- [ ] **Does this make the system easier to change?** (CA-2, CA-3)
- [ ] **Are dependencies pointing in the right direction?** (CA-12, CA-31)
- [ ] **Can I defer this decision?** (CA-21, CA-44)
- [ ] **Is this true duplication or accidental similarity?** (CA-25)
- [ ] **Does the structure scream the business purpose?** (CA-30)
- [ ] **Can I test this without infrastructure?** (CA-46, CA-48)
- [ ] **Is the framework a detail, not a foundation?** (CA-38, CA-47)
